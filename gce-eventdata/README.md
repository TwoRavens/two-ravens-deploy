# Deploying EventData on Google Compute Engine (gce)

These steps deploy the TwoRavens EventData application using Docker images from https://hub.docker.com/r/tworavens/

- **Prerequisite**: admin permissions on the gce kubernetes cluster running event data

## (1) Steps to Build Docker Images

1. In your dev environment, run `fab webpack_prod` to build the latest code into a webpack distribution.
     - Check in any new js/css dist files, if needed
1. **(rare)** If new R packages were added to this file:
    - https://github.com/TwoRavens/TwoRavens/blob/EventData_Mithril/setup/r-base/Dockerfile-eventdata
    - Then rebuild this image by clicking the "Trigger" button (right, mid side of screen):
        -https://hub.docker.com/r/tworavens/eventdata-r-service-base/~/settings/automated-builds/
1. Build the eventdata docker hub images by clicking the "Trigger" button (right, mid side of screen):
    - Main Two Ravens: https://hub.docker.com/r/tworavens/eventdata-ravens-main/~/settings/automated-builds/
    - When complete, this will kick off builds for [tworavens/eventdata-ravens-nginx](https://hub.docker.com/r/tworavens/eventdata-ravens-nginx/) and [tworavens/eventdata-ravens-r-service](https://hub.docker.com/r/tworavens/eventdata-ravens-r-service/)


## (2) GCE Deploy - Shortcuts (if you've done it before)

1. Go to the cluster list and "connect" to a Terminal
    - https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list

```
# pull the latest config code
#
cd two-ravens-deploy/gce-eventdata
git pull

# deployment
#
kubectl delete -f eventdata-deploy.yml  # stop the current deployment
kubectl apply -f eventdata-deploy.yml  # start a new deployment

# create service, e.g. expose the deployment to the web
# - usually already running
#
kubectl apply -f eventdata-service.yml  # expose the app to the web/external IP
kubectl delete -f eventdata-service.yml # stop the service

# ---------------
# other
# ---------------

# list pods, the name of the eventdata pod is "ravens-eventdata-web-xxxxxx-xxxx"
#
kubectl get pods

# describe pod using name from "kubectl get pods"
#   - will tell if there are errors starting containers
#
kubectl describe pod ravens-eventdata-web-xxxxxx-xxxx

# See a log for a container, e.g. what you see in the rook Terminal when running locally
#   - `kubectl logs -f .....` will stream the log
#
kubectl logs ravens-eventdata-web-xxxxxx-xxxx rook-service  # rook server log
kubectl logs ravens-eventdata-web-xxxxxx-xxxx ta3-main  # python server log
kubectl logs ravens-eventdata-web-xxxxxx-xxxx ravens-nginx  # nginx log

# Log into a running container with full admin rights
#   - e.g. look around, see if files are being created, stop/start things, etc
#
kubectl exec -ti  ravens-eventdata-web-xxxxxx-xxxx -c rook-service /bin/bash
kubectl exec -ti  ravens-eventdata-web-xxxxxx-xxxx -c ta3-main /bin/bash
kubectl exec -ti  ravens-eventdata-web-xxxxxx-xxxx -c ravens-nginx /bin/bash

```
## (2) GCE Deploy - Longer explanation

## Open a Terminal within a browser (Chrome)

1. Go to the cluster list:
    - https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list
    - `cluster-1` should appear as a row in the main part of the page
1. Click "connect" which opens a shell in the browser
1. Click "Run in Cloud Shell"
    - A Terminal window opens in the browser
1. Press the "return" key to execute the auto-added line.  Usually something like this:
    - `gcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster-1 --zone us-central1-a --project raven2-186120`

## Create the eventdata "Deployment"

- Run these steps from the Terminal (previous step).  These steps pull the appropriate Docker images (nginx, python server, rook server) from Docker hub

```
cd two-ravens-deploy/gce-eventdata
git pull  # get the latest k8s config info

# Stop any running deployments
#   - if nothing was running, you'll see "Error from server (NotFound):..."
#     - that's fine
#
kubectl delete -f eventdata-deploy.yml


# Create a new deployment
#   - should see a message like: deployment "ravens-eventdata-web" created
#
kubectl apply -f eventdata-deploy.yml

# Run service:
#
kubectl apply -f eventdata-service.yml


# Wait for service to have IP assigned
#
kubectl get svc

# Check progress
#
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod [pod name from previous command]
```

## Stop the eventdata "Deployment"

- Open the gce Terminal from a browser (see steps above)

```
cd two-ravens-deploy/gce-eventdata
git pull  # get the latest k8s config info

# Stop any running deployments
#
kubectl delete -f eventdata-deploy.yml

# Stop any running services
#
kubectl delete -f eventdata-deploy.yml
```

## Misc notes

### local run

```
sudo kubectl port-forward ravens-eventdata-web-833262626-v1mgs 80:80
```

### downsize cluster

- Set size to zero

```
gcloud container clusters resize cluster-1 --size=0 --zone=us-central1-a
```

### get cluster going again

- Set size back to 3 (or 2)

```
gcloud container clusters resize cluster-1 --size=2 --zone=us-central1-a
```
